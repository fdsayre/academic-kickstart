I'm an experienced science librarian passionate about supporting students and researchers achieve their goals. My research interests include how librarians and other information profesionals can support reproducible research, computational methods, open science, innovation, and entrepreneurship. I also run, cook, meditate, read, and endlessly plan trips.
